Uppercase letters are white pieces
Lowercase letters are black pieces

The pieces are the following:
Q -> Queen  
K -> King
P -> Pawn
B -> Bishop
R -> Rook
N -> Knight

White pieces start, notation used for movement is long-notation:

Normal move -> First char for piece (except pawn), then initial position and ending position
Example 1 -> Ra1a4 moves the Rook from a1 to a4 
Example 2 -> e2e4 Moves pawn from e2 to e4

Take -> I dunno
